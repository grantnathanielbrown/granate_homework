Design and build an app that displays a list of restaurants. Each restaurant has a name, cuisine type, and star ranking. The user should be able to search by restaurant name, filter restaurants by cuisine type, and sort by star ranking. This may be a web app or native app. The app does not need to be deployed anywhere but it should be able to run locally.

For the most part, I have designed this with the intention of simulating how an actual application would work.
